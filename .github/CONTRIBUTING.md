# Contributing to Blogifier
Thanks for contributing to the Blogifier. If you haven't already, please setup your environment and [run the Blogifier locally](https://github.com/blogifierdotnet/Blogifier/blob/main/README.md#development).

## This project receives code contributions from any feature
The current Blogifier is not perfect enough, blog software pursues perfect functions and easy to use, maybe [wordpress](https://wordpress.org) is more suitable, relatively speaking, this project still lacks many functions. The latest version has not been released yet, and the current project is more suitable for developers to build and use by themselves. We can work together Improvement, implement a blog system completely implemented by dotnet technology. Faster, simpler, and smaller.

You can first propose functions in issues and develop them in pull requests, so that you can track the development progress. Everyone is welcome to participate in the development together. Let's learn and explore the latest technology of dotnet together.
